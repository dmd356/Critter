# Critter

This might be  a bit broken as it was a backup file that I found of my old work a year ago at 
Tech Elevator, Columbus(January-April 2017). The code however should serve to show that I understand the basics of 
Full Stack programming and object-oriented programming in Java. I understand how to connect to a database as well as run tests
to debug my code as well.
